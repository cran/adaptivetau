Description: Implements adaptive tau leaping to approximate the
        trajectory of a continuous-time stochastic process as
        described by Cao et al. (2007) The Journal of Chemical Physics
        <doi:10.1063/1.2745299> (aka. the Gillespie stochastic
        simulation algorithm).  This package is based upon work
        supported by NSF DBI-0906041 and NIH K99-GM104158 to Philip
        Johnson and NIH R01-AI049334 to Rustom Antia.
