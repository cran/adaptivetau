----------------------------
Version 1.1 - 27 July 2013
----------------------------
  - Fix use of "eval" by using R_EmptyEnv instead of NULL.
  - Revert memory leak prevention / error handling code due to not
    being part of the public R API (as pointed out by Brian Ripley,
    only public API is allowed in CRAN).  Unfortunately interrupting
    execution will now almost certainly lead to memory leaking.

----------------------------
Version 1.0-1 - 27 Sept 2012
----------------------------
  - Fixed validity check that aborts on non-integer initial conditions
    (previously was being too permissive).
  - removed .Rhistory file accidently left under /vignettes directory

------------------------
Version 1.0 - 9 Apr 2012
------------------------
  - Fixed memory bug which could, under some circumstances, have lead
    to segmentation fault from premature garbage collection.
  - Fixed implementation of implicit tau-leaping algorithm (used when
    Jacobian supplied & specified by adaptive tau algorithm) and
    clarified corresponding documentation.
  - Fixed error handling to free memory allocated in heap upon abort
  - Added new entrypoint -- ssa.exact -- that directly runs the "exact"
    simulation C++ function rather than the tau-leaping algorithm.
  - Made algorithm more robust for deterministic transitions.
  - Improved error messages when passed invalid initial conditions or
    rate function.
  - Byte-code compile user rate functions if compiler package is available.
  - Allow ssa.maketrans to handle variable names in addition to indices.
  - Wrote vignette with three examples.

---------------------------
Version 0.902 - 30 Dec 2010
---------------------------
  - Fix Solaris compiler errors.

---------------------------
Version 0.901 - 12 Nov 2010
---------------------------
  - Fix non-portable use of LAPACK_LIBS.  Thanks to Brian Ripley.

-------------------------
Version 0.9 - 19 Oct 2010
-------------------------
  - First version in CRAN
