----------------------------
Version 2.2-1 - 19 Sept 2016
----------------------------
  - rework to avoid usage of C99 features not included in C++98
  - use title case for package title in DESCRIPTION
  - update maintainer email address

----------------------------
Version 2.2 - 19 Nov 2014
----------------------------
  - Add check for infinite transition rate; if found, abort with a
    meaningful warning message and return results generated until this point.
  - If abort due to user interrupt, now return results generated so far.

----------------------------
Version 2.1 - 8 May 2014
----------------------------
  - Remove automatic byte-code compilation of R rate functions handed
    to ssa.adaptivetau (previously had been using library(compile)).
    Previous behavior led to significant inefficiencies if
    ssa.adaptivetau was called multiple times with the same rate
    function; thanks to Sebastian Funk for raising this issue.
    Instead, modify documentation to recommend that users use
    enableJIT(1).

----------------------------
Version 2.0 - 24 Mar 2014
----------------------------
  - transition matrix ("nu") can now be specified with an
    alternative data structure to reduce memory usage for large sparse
    matrices
  - new feature: transitions may be designated as "halting", which
    will cause simulation to stop after executing one of these
    transitions
  - streamlined code for dealing with transition classification
  - call PutRNGstate before calling user-supplied rate function.
    While the rate function itself must not be stochastic, if a
    unnecessary call to Get/PutRNGState were to occur (e.g., as done
    by Rcpp at entry/exit to all exported functions), the adaptivetau
    algorithm could get scrambled.  Adding this call covers this
    situation at relatively low cost.
  - fix vignette typo
  - bug fix: incorrect type allocation for R_NamesSymbol; thanks to
    Brian Ripley for catching.
  - handle case where final time ("tf" parameter) is an integer data
    type; thanks to Sebastian Funk for sending a patch.

----------------------------
Version 1.1-1 - 11 Nov 2013
----------------------------
  - Remove #include <cmath>, which appears (?) to have been
    unnecessary and causes a conflict when using isnan with -std=c++11
    and "using namespace std".
  - Replace "isnan" (from standard) with "ISNAN" (R macro to ensure
    portability)
  - also remove stray files from vignette directory

----------------------------
Version 1.1 - 27 July 2013
----------------------------
  - Fix use of "eval" by using R_EmptyEnv instead of NULL.
  - Revert memory leak prevention / error handling code due to not
    being part of the public R API (as pointed out by Brian Ripley,
    only public API is allowed in CRAN).  Unfortunately interrupting
    execution will now almost certainly lead to memory leaking.

----------------------------
Version 1.0-1 - 27 Sept 2012
----------------------------
  - Fixed validity check that aborts on non-integer initial conditions
    (previously was being too permissive).
  - removed .Rhistory file accidently left under /vignettes directory

------------------------
Version 1.0 - 9 Apr 2012
------------------------
  - Fixed memory bug which could, under some circumstances, have lead
    to segmentation fault from premature garbage collection.
  - Fixed implementation of implicit tau-leaping algorithm (used when
    Jacobian supplied & specified by adaptive tau algorithm) and
    clarified corresponding documentation.
  - Fixed error handling to free memory allocated in heap upon abort
  - Added new entrypoint -- ssa.exact -- that directly runs the "exact"
    simulation C++ function rather than the tau-leaping algorithm.
  - Made algorithm more robust for deterministic transitions.
  - Improved error messages when passed invalid initial conditions or
    rate function.
  - Byte-code compile user rate functions if compiler package is available.
  - Allow ssa.maketrans to handle variable names in addition to indices.
  - Wrote vignette with three examples.

---------------------------
Version 0.902 - 30 Dec 2010
---------------------------
  - Fix Solaris compiler errors.

---------------------------
Version 0.901 - 12 Nov 2010
---------------------------
  - Fix non-portable use of LAPACK_LIBS.  Thanks to Brian Ripley.

-------------------------
Version 0.9 - 19 Oct 2010
-------------------------
  - First version in CRAN
