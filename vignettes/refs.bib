  abstract       = {Few infectious diseases are entirely human-specific:
                   Most human pathogens also circulate in animals or else
                   originated in nonhuman hosts. Influenza, plague, and
                   trypanosomiasis are classic examples of zoonotic
                   infections that transmit from animals to humans. The
                   multihost ecology of zoonoses leads to complex
                   dynamics, and analytical tools, such as mathematical
                   modeling, are vital to the development of effective
                   control policies and research agendas. Much attention
                   has focused on modeling pathogens with simpler life
                   cycles and immediate global urgency, such as influenza
                   and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Meanwhile,
                   vector-transmitted, chronic, and protozoan infections
                   have been neglected, as have crucial processes such as
                   cross-species transmission. Progress in understanding
                   and combating zoonoses requires a new generation of
                   models that addresses a broader set of pathogen life
                   histories and integrates across host species and
                   scientific disciplines.},
